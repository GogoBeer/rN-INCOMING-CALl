Coding Style (General)
----------------------

Various coding styles have been used during the history of the codebase,
and the result is not very consistent. However, we're now trying to converge to
a single style, which is specified below. When writing patches, favor the new
style over attempting to mimic the surrounding style, except for move-only
commits.

Do not submit patches solely to modify the style of existing code.

Coding Style (C++)
------------------

- **Indentation and whitespace rules** as specified in
[src/.clang-format](/src/.clang-format). You can use the provided
[clang-format-diff script](/contrib/devtools/README.md#clang-format-diffpy)
tool to clean up patches automatically before submission.
  - Braces on new lines for classes, functions, methods.
  - Braces on the same line for everything else.
  - 4 space indentation (no tabs) for every block except namespaces.
  - No indentation for `public`/`protected`/`private` or for `namespace`.
  - No extra spaces inside parenthesis; don't do `( this )`.
  - No space after function names; one space after `if`, `for` and `while`.
  - If an `if` only has a single-statement `then`-clause, it can appear
    on the same line as the `if`, without braces. In every other case,
    braces are required, and the `then` and `else` clauses must appear
    correctly indented on a new line.
  - There's no hard limit on line width, but prefer to keep lines to <100
    characters if doing so does not decrease readability. Break up long
    function declarations over multiple lines using the Clang Format
    [AlignAfterOpenBracket](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html)
    style option.

- **Symbol naming conventions**. These are preferred in new code, but are not
required when doing so would need changes to significant pieces of existing
code.
  - Variable (including function arguments) and namespace names are all lowercase and may use `_` to
    separate words (snake_case).
    - Class member variables have a `m_` prefix.
    - Global variables have a `g_` prefix.
  - Constant names are all uppercase, and use `_` to separate words.
  - Enumerator constants may be `snake_case`, `PascalCase` or `ALL_CAPS`.
    This is a more tolerant policy than the [C++ Core
    Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Renum-caps),
    which recommend using `snake_case`.  Please use what seems appropriate.
  - Class names, function names, and method names are UpperCamelCase
    (PascalCase). Do not prefix class names with `C`.
  - Test suite naming convention: The Boost test suite in file
    `src/test/foo_tests.cpp` should be named `foo_tests`. Test suite names
    must be unique.

- **Miscellaneous**
  - `++i` is preferred over `i++`.
  - `nullptr` is preferred over `NULL` or `(void*)0`.
  - `static_assert` is preferred over `assert` where possible. Generally; compile-time checking is preferred over run-time checking.

Block style example:
```c++
int g_count = 0;

namespace foo {
class Class
{
    std::string m_name;

public:
    bool Function(const std::string& s, int n)
    {
        // Comment summarising what this section of code does
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int total_sum = 0;
            // When something fails, return early
            if (!Something()) return false;
            ...
            if (SomethingElse(i)) {
                total_sum += ComputeSomething(g_count);
            } else {
                DoSomething(m_name, total_sum);
            }
        }

        // Success return is usually at the end
        return true;
    }
}
} // namespace foo
```

Coding Style (Python)
---------------------

Refer to [/test/functional/README.md#style-guidelines](/test/functional/README.md#style-guidelines).

Coding Style (Doxygen-compatible comments)
------------------------------------------

Bitcoin Core uses [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) to generate its official documentation.

Use Doxygen-compatible comment blocks for functions, methods, and fields.

For example, to describe a function use:

```c++
/**
 * ... Description ...
 *
 * @param[in]  arg1 input description...
 * @param[in]  arg2 input description...
 * @param[out] arg3 output description...
 * @return Return cases...
 * @throws Error type and cases...
 * @pre  Pre-condition for function...
 * @post Post-condition for function...
 */
bool function(int arg1, const char *arg2, std::string& arg3)
```

A complete list of `@xxx` commands can be found at https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html.
As Doxygen recognizes the comments by the delimiters (`/**` and `*/` in this case), you don't
*need* to provide any commands for a comment to be valid; just a description text is fine.

To describe a class, use the same construct above the class definition:
```c++
/**
 * Alerts are for notifying old versions if they become too obsolete and
 * need to upgrade. The message is displayed in the status bar.
 * @see GetWarnings()
 */
class CAlert
```

To describe a member or variable use:
```c++
//! Description before the member
int var;
```

or
```c++
int var; //!< Description after the member
```

Also OK:
```c++
///
/// ... Description ...
///
bool function2(int arg1, const char *arg2)
```

Not picked up by Doxygen:
```c++
//
// ... Description ...
//
```

Also not picked up by Doxygen:
```c++
/*
 * ... Description ...
 */
```

A full list of comment syntaxes picked up by Doxygen can be found at https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html,
but the above styles are favored.

Recommendations:

- Avoiding duplicating type and input/output information in function
  descriptions.

- Use backticks (&#96;&#96;) to refer to `argument` names in function and
  parameter descriptions.

- Backticks aren't required when referring to functions Doxygen already knows
  about; it will build hyperlinks for these automatically. See
  https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/autolink.html for complete info.

- Avoid linking to external documentation; links ca
