How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the 
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)
or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).

The first time you run version 0.15.0, your chainstate database will be converted to a
new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,
depending on the speed of your machine.

The file format of `fee_estimates.dat` changed in version 0.15.0. Hence, a
downgrade from version 0.15.0 or upgrade to version 0.15.0 will cause all fee
estimates to be discarded.

Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no
automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0. Upgrading
directly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not supported.
However, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.

Downgrading warning
-------------------

The chainstate database for this release is not compatible with previous
releases, so if you run 0.15 and then decide to switch back to any
older version, you will need to run the old release with the `-reindex-chainstate`
option to rebuild the chainstate data structures in the old format.

If your node has pruning enabled, this will entail re-downloading and
processing the entire blockchain.

Compatibility
==============

Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.

Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.

Notes for 0.15.0
================

Current SegWit support
----------------------

Version 0.15.0 supports adding a segregated witness address via the `addwitnessaddress` RPC, but
please note that this is a testing/expert RPC, which does not guarantee recovery from backup. Only use
this RPC if you know what you are doing. More complete wallet support for segregated witness is coming
in a next version.

Rescanning with encrypted wallets
---------------------------------

As in previous versions, when using an encrypted HD wallet, the keypool cannot be topped up without unlocking
the wallet. This means that currently, in order to recover from a backup of an encrypted HD wallet, the user
must unlock the wallet with a really long timeout and manually trigger a rescan, otherwise they risk missing
some keys when auto-topup cannot run. Unfortunately there is no `rescan` RPC in this version, that will be
included in a future version, so for now a rescan can be triggered using one of the `import*` commands, using
a dummy address generated by another (trusted) wallet.

Notable changes
===============

Performance Improvements
------------------------

Version 0.15 contains a number of significant performance improvements, which make
Initial Block Download, startup, transaction and block validation much faster:

- The chainstate database (which is used for tracking UTXOs) has been changed
  from a per-transaction model to a per-output model (See [PR 10195](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10195)). Advantages of this model
  are that it:
    - avoids the CPU overhead of deserializing and serializing the unused outputs;
    - has more predictable memory usage;
    - uses simpler code;
    - is adaptable to various future cache flushing strategies.

  As a result, validating the blockchain during Initial Block Download (IBD) and reindex
  is ~30-40% faster, uses 10-20% less memory, and flushes to disk far less frequently.
  The only downside is that the on-disk database is 15% larger. During the conversion from the previous format
  a few extra gigabytes may be used.
- Earlier versions experienced a spike in memory usage while flushing UTXO updates to disk.
  As a result, only half of the available memory was actually used as cache, and the other half was
  reserved to accommodate flushing. This is no longer the case (See [PR 10148](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10148)), and the entirety of
  the available cache (see `-dbcache`) is now actually used as cache. This reduces the flushing
  frequency by a factor 2 or more.
- In previous versions, signature validation for transactions has been cached when the
  transaction is accepted to the mempool. Version 0.15 extends this to cache the entire script
  validity (See [PR 10192](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10192)). This means that if a transaction in a block has already been accepted to the
  mempool, the scriptSig does not need to be re-evaluated. Empirical tests show that
  this results in new block validation being 40-50% faster.
- LevelDB has been upgraded to version 1.20 (See [PR 10544](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10544)). This version contains hardware acceleration for CRC
  on architectures supporting SSE 4.2. As a result, synchronization and block validation are now faster.
- SHA256 hashing has been optimized for architectures supporting SSE 4 (See [PR 10821](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10821)). SHA256 is around
  50% faster on supported hardware, which results in around 5% faster IBD and block
