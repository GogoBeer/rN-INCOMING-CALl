How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)
or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is
possible, but might take some time if the datadir needs to be migrated.  Old
wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.

Compatibility
==============

Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer. It is not recommended
to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems.

Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
as frequently tested on them.

From 0.17.0 onwards, macOS <10.10 is no longer supported. 0.17.0 is
built using Qt 5.9.x, which doesn't support versions of macOS older than
10.10. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance when
macOS "dark mode" is activated.

Users running macOS Catalina may need to "right-click" and then choose "Open"
to open the Bitcoin Core .dmg. This is due to new signing requirements
imposed by Apple, which the Bitcoin Core project does not yet adhere too.

Notable changes
===============

New user documentation
----------------------

- [Reduce memory](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/reduce-memory.md)
  suggests configuration tweaks for running Bitcoin Core on systems with
  limited memory. (#16339)

New RPCs
--------

- `getbalances` returns an object with all balances (`mine`,
  `untrusted_pending` and `immature`). Please refer to the RPC help of
  `getbalances` for details. The new RPC is intended to replace
  `getbalance`, `getunconfirmedbalance`, and the balance fields in
  `getwalletinfo`.  These old calls and fields may be removed in a
  future version. (#15930, #16239)

- `setwalletflag` sets and unsets wallet flags that enable or disable
  features specific to that existing wallet, such as the new
  `avoid_reuse` feature documented elsewhere in these release notes.
  (#13756)

- `getblockfilter` gets the BIP158 filter for the specified block.  This
  RPC is only enabled if block filters have been created using the
  `-bl
