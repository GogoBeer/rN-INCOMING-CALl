Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or
bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).

Downgrade warning
-----------------

### Downgrade to a version < 0.10.0

Because release 0.10.0 and later makes use of headers-first synchronization and
parallel block download (see further), the block files and databases are not
backwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software:

* Blocks will be stored on disk out of order (in the order they are
received, really), which makes it incompatible with some tools or
other programs. Reindexing using earlier versions will also not work
anymore as a result of this.

* The block index database will now hold headers for which no block is
stored on disk, which earlier versions won't support.

If you want to be able to downgrade smoothly, make a backup of your entire data
directory. Without this your node will need start syncing (or importing from
bootstrap.dat) anew afterwards. It is possible that the data from a completely
synchronised 0.10 node may be usable in older versions as-is, but this is not
supported and may break as soon as the older version attempts to reindex.

This does not affect wallet forward or backward compatibility.

### Downgrade to a version < 0.12.0

Because release 0.12.0 and later will obfuscate the chainstate on every
fresh sync or reindex, the chainstate is not backwards-compatible with
pre-0.12 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software.

If you want to downgrade after you have done a reindex with 0.12.0 or later,
you will need to reindex when you first start Bitcoin Core version 0.11 or
earlier.

Notable changes
===============

Signature validation using libsecp256k1
---------------------------------------

ECDSA signatures inside Bitcoin transactions now use validation using
[libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1) instead of OpenSSL.

Depending on the platform, this means a significant speedup for raw signature
validation speed. The advantage is largest on x86_64, where validation is over
five times faster. In practice, this translates to a raw reindexing and new
block validation times that are less than half of what it was before.

Libsecp256k1 has undergone very extensive testing and validation.

A side effect of this change is that libconsensus no longer depends on OpenSSL.

Reduce upload traffic
---------------------

A major part of the outbound traffic is caused by serving historic blocks to
other nodes in initial block download state.

It is now possible to reduce the total upload traffic via the `-maxuploadtarget`
parameter. This is *not* a hard limit but a threshold to minimize the outbound
traffic. When the limit is about to be reached, the uploaded data is cut by not
serving historic blocks (blocks older than one week).
Moreover, any SPV peer is disconnected when they request a filtered block.

This option can be specified in MiB per day and is turned off by default
(`-maxuploadtarget=0`).
The recommended minimum is 144 * MAX_BLOCK_SIZE (currently 144MB) per day.

Whitelisted peers will never be disconnected, although their traffic counts for
calculating the target.

A more detailed documentation about keeping traffic low can be found in
[/doc/reduce-traffic.md](/doc/reduce-traffic.md).

Direct headers announcement (BIP 130)
-------------------------------------

Between compatible peers, [BIP 130]
(https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0130.mediawiki)
direct headers announcement is used. This means that blocks are advertised by
announcing their headers directly, instead of just announcing the hash. In a
reorganization, all new headers are sent, instead of just the new tip. This
can often prevent an extra roundtrip before the actual block is downloaded.

Memory pool limiting
--------------------

Previous versions of Bitcoin Core had their mempool limited by checking
a transaction's fees against the node's minimum relay fee. There was no
upper bound on the size of the mempool and attackers could send a large
number of transactions paying just slighly more than the default minimum
relay fee to crash nodes with relatively low RAM. A temporary workaround
for previous versions of Bitcoin Core was to raise the default minimum
relay fee.

Bitcoin Core 0.12 will have a strict maximum size on the mempool. The
default value is 300 MB and can be configured with the `-maxmempool`
parameter. Whenever a transaction would cause the mempool to exceed
its maximum size, the transaction that (along with in-mempool descendants) has
the lowest total feerate (as a package) will be evicted and the node's effective
minimum relay feerate will be increased to match this feerate plus the initial
minimum relay feerate. The initial minimum relay feerate is set to
1000 satoshis per kB.

Bitcoin Core 0.12 also introduces new default policy limits on the length and
size of unconfirmed transaction chains that are allowed in the mempool
(generally limiting the length of unconfirmed chains to 25 transactions, with a
total size of 101 KB).  These limits can be overridden using command line
arguments; see the extended help (`--help -help-debug`) for more information.

Opt-in Replace-by-fee transactions
----------------------------------

It is now possible to replace transactions in the transaction memory pool of
Bitcoin Core 0.12 nodes. Bitcoin Core will only allow replacement of
transactions which have any of their inputs' `nSequence` number set to less
than `0xffffffff - 1`.  Moreover, a replacement transaction may only be
accepted when it pays sufficient fee, as described in [BIP 125]
(https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki).

Transaction replacement can be disabled with a new command line option,
`-mempoolreplacement=0`.  Transactions signaling replacement under BIP125 will
still be allowed into the mempool in this configuration, but replacements will
be rejected.  This option is intended for miners who want to continue the
transaction selection behavior of previous releases.

The `-mempoolreplacement` option is *not recommended* for wallet users seeking
to avoid receipt of unconfirmed opt-in transactions, because this option does
not prevent transactions which are replaceable under BIP 125 from being accepted
(only subsequent replacements, which other nodes on the network that implement
BIP 125 are likely to relay and mine).  Wallet users wishing to detect whether
a transaction is subject to replacement under BIP 125 should instead use the
updated RPC calls `gettransaction` and `listtransactions`, which now have an
additional field in the output indicating if a transaction is replaceable under
BIP125 ("bip125-replaceable").

Note that the wallet in Bitcoin Core 0.12 does not yet have support for
creating transactions that would be replaceable under BIP 125.


RPC: Random-cookie RPC authentication
-------------------------------------

When no `-rpcpassword` is specified, the daemon now uses a special 'cookie'
file for authentication. This file is generated with random content when the
daemon starts, and deleted when it exits. Its contents are used as
authentication token. Read access to this file controls who can access through
RPC. By default it is stored in the data directory but its location can be
overridden with the option `-rpccookiefile`.

This is similar to Tor's CookieAuthentication: see
https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en

This allows running bitcoind without having to do any manual configuration.

Relay: Any sequence of pushdatas in OP_RETURN outputs now allowed
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Previously OP_RETURN outputs with a payload were only relayed and mined if they
had a single pushdata. This restriction has been lifted to allow any
combination of data pushes and numeric constant opcodes (OP_1 to OP_16) after
the OP_RETURN. The limit on OP_RETURN output size is now applied to the entire
serialized scriptPubKey, 83 bytes by default. (the previous 80 byte default plus
three bytes overhead)

Relay: New and only new blocks relayed when pruning
---------------------------------------------------

When running in pruned mode, the
