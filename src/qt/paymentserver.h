#ifndef BITCOIN_QT_PAYMENTSERVER_H
#define BITCOIN_QT_PAYMENTSERVER_H

// This class handles payment requests from clicking on
// bitcoin: URIs
//
// This is somewhat tricky, because we have to deal with
// the situation where the user clicks on a link during
// startup/initialization, when the splash-screen is up
// but the main window (and the Send Coins tab) is not.
//
// So, the strategy is:
//
// Create the server, and register the event handler,
// when the application is created. Save any URIs
// received at or during startup in a list.
//
// When startup is finished and the main window is
// shown, a signal is sent to slot uiReady(), which
// emits a receivedURI() signal for any payment
// requests that happened during startup.
//
// After startup, receivedURI() happens as usual.
//
// This class has one more feature: a static
// method that finds URIs passed in the command line
// and, if a server is running in another process,
// sends them to the server.
