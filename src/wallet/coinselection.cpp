/*
 * This is the Branch and Bound Coin Selection algorithm designed by Murch. It searches for an input
 * set that can pay for the spending target and does not exceed the spending target by more than the
 * cost of creating and spending a change output. The algorithm uses a depth-first search on a binary
 * tree. In the binary tree, each node corresponds to the inclusion or the omission of a UTXO. UTXOs
 * are sorted by their effective values and the tree is explored deterministically per the inclusion
 * branch first. At each node, the algorithm checks whether the selection is within the target range.
 * While the selection has not reached the target range, more UTXOs are included. When a selection's
 * value exceeds the target range, the complete subtree deriving from this selection can be omitted.
 * At that point, the last included UTXO is deselected and the corresponding omission branch explored
 * instead. The search ends after the complete tree has been searched or after a limited number of tries.
 *
 * The search continues to search for better solutions after one solution has been found. The best
 * solution is chosen by minimizing the waste metric. The waste metric is defined as the cost to
 * spend the current inputs at the given fee rate minus the long term expected cost to spend the
 * inputs, plus the amount by which the selection exceeds the spending target:
 *
 * waste = selectionTotal - target + inputs Ã— (currentFeeRate - longTermFeeRate)
 *
 * The algorithm uses two additional optimizations. A lookahead keeps track of the total value of
 * the unexplored UTXOs. A subtree is not explored if the lookahead indicates that the target range
 * cannot be reached. Further, it is unnecessary to test equivalent combinations. This allows us
 * to skip testing the inclusion of UTXOs that match the effective value and waste of an omitted
 * predecessor.
 *
 * The Branch and Bound algorithm is described in detail in Murch's Master Thesis:
 * https://murch.one/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/erhardt2016coinselection.pdf

 * @param const std::vector<CInputCoin>& utxo_pool The set of UTXOs that we are choosing from.
 *        These UTXOs will be sorted in descending order by effective value and the CInputCoins'
 *        values are their effective values.
 * @param const CAmount& selection_target This is the value that we want to select. It is the lower
 *        bound of the range.
 * @param const CAmount& cost_of_change This is the cost of creating and spending a change output.
 *        This plus selection_target is the upper bound of the range.
 * @returns The result of this coin selection algorithm, or std::nullopt
